# SecSign ID
This app makes it possible to use the SecSign two-factor authentication SecSign ID
to authenticate users in Nextcloud.

Once installed, go to **Settings/Security** and add an existing SecSign ID to enable 2FA
for yourself. Make sure to also generate backup codes, so you always have a backup plan.

Admins can go to the SecSign ID tab and manage the SecSign IDs for every user and enable/disable
two-factor authentication.

If you do not already have a SecSign ID, go to [secsign.com](https://www.secsign.com/try-secsign-id-now/) to learn
how to create and use one.
